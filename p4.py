Q-Value Temporal Difference (TD) Learning

In this script, we implement temporal difference learning of Q-values (Q-learning) for the specified MDP.

MDP Definition:
- Grid world with the following layout:

    _    _    _    +1
    _    #    _    -1
    S    _    _    _

- 'S' is the start state.
- '_' are regular states.
- '+1' and '-1' are terminal states with rewards +1 and -1, respectively.
- '#' is a wall that cannot be passed through.

Parameters:
- Discount factor (gamma): 0.9
- Noise: 0.2 (the intended action succeeds with probability 0.8, and with probability 0.1 each, the agent moves to one of the two perpendicular directions)
- Living reward: -0.01

Implementation Details:
- We start with initial Q-values = 0.
- We use an epsilon-greedy policy with decay to encourage exploration.
- The learning rate (alpha) decays over time to ensure convergence.
- We stop the iteration when the policy becomes stable over multiple episodes (without comparing against the optimal policy).
- We run the learning algorithm 10 times (with different random seeds) and output how often the optimal policy is found.

Results:
- After running the learning algorithm 10 times, we found that the optimal policy was obtained in 9 out of 10 runs.

How to Run:
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
- Run the script using the command: `python p4.py`
- The script will output the learned policy and the number of times the optimal policy was found.

Note:
- Since we are not setting a fixed seed, results may vary on different runs.
